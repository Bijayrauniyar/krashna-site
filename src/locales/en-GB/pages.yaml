choir:
  title: Choir
  text: >
    The Krashna choir is a group of about 50 enthusiastic singers. We come together every Wednesday night in order to work a diverse repertoire of classical music and our own singing skills. There is no audition for the choir, so we are looking for both experienced and starting singers. Every year the choir does two or three big projects. By varying the repertoire as much as possible, there is always a new challenge both in studying new notes and mastering a new form of expression. Guided by our capable choir conductor, even the less-experienced singers will be able to sing comfortably, while the choir maintains a high quality of sound. The choir recently sang Fauré’s Requiem, Magnificat by Rutter, Kytice by Martinu, Messa di Gloria by Puccini. Additionally, the choir has performed beautiful a-Capella pieces like the Requiem of Daily.

orchestra:
  title: Orchestra
  text: >
    The orchestra of 'Delfts Studenten Muziek Gezelschap' Krashna Musika currently has approximatly 60 members. It has an occupation of a standard symphony orchestra with which high quality music is performed. The repertoire usually consists of great classical works, but there is room for more modern works. Recent examples are 'Tod und Verklärung' by R. Strauss, 'Isle of the dead' by Rachmaninoff, the 5th symphony by Shostakovich, and Mahler's 'Das Lied von der Erde'. Krashna gives two concert series every year where both the choir and the orchestra perform. The choir piece is then usually also accompanied by the orchestra (usually in a smaller setting). Pieces that have recently been performed with the choir are the Mozart Requiem, 'Kytice' by Martinu and 'Messa di Gloria' by Puccini.

      Our choir conductor: Ruben de Grauw
    text: |
      Ruben de Grauw (1980) started singing at a very young age. When he was 7, he joined the Sacramentskoor in Breda. When he was 16, he started his own choir: 'Jeugdkamerkoor Plurale Tantum', for young singers between 15 and 25 years of age. After conducting this choir for eighteen years, he left the choir in 2015. Ruben studied Choir conducting from Wiecher Mandemaker at the Conservatory of Rotterdam. In 2004 he followed up his Bachelor degree with a Master of Music from Louis Buskens at Fontys Conservatory in Tilburg. Between 2009 and 2013 Ruben was assistant-conductor at the 'Nederlands Studenten kamerkoor' and he is currently the conductor of the project choir Cappella Ex Occasione in Breda, and naturally the student choir of Krashna Musika in Delft. Recently Ruben became consultant of amateur art at the foundation Nieuwe Veste in Breda. Ruben is still active as a singer. He is a tenor at the Laurens Collegium in Rotterdam and Studium Chorale in Maastricht.

      We are very happy to say that Ruben has been leading Krashna's choir since November 2011.

chamber-music:
  title: Chamber Music
  text: |
    Next to the choir and orchestra, Krashna knows a third department: the chamber music department. This department is unique for student music associations in the Netherlands. Chamber music members get the opportunity to form ensembles to perform their own chosen music on the chamber music concerts. The ensembles are diverse with respect to their level, repertoire and setting. Soloist are also allowed to perform.

    There are about six chamber music concerts each year and they are open to all public. Furthermore, Krashna organises lunch concerts in some of the faculties of the TU Delft each year, where employees and students of that faculty are also invited to perform. Finally, there is a masterclass each year where Krashna ensembles are coached by professional chamber musicians. These masterclasses are also open to public.

chamber-choir:
  title: Chamber Choir
  text: |
    The Krashna Chamber Choir is a small group of about 16 singers who also sing in the Krashna Choir. Since the rehearsal tempo of the chamber choir is higher than that of the choir, the members of the chamber choir are expected to prepare their own parts at home.  As a consequence, the chamber choir can invest a lot of time in developing the quality of sound during the rehearsals.

    Every project of the chamber choir features classical pieces from many musical periods and composers. Depending on the theme of the project, it could happen that the repertoire includes pieces of both Tichely and Morley. In contrast to the choir and the orchestra, the chamber choirs aims to have a different conductor for every concert. Consequently, every project will sound different, corresponding to the interpretation of a different conductor.

chamber-orchestra:
  title: Chamber Orchestra
  text: |
    Orchestra members regularly organise chamber orchestra projects as well. With KrashKO (Krashna Chamber Orchestra), members play in a smaller orchestra conducted by varying (young) conductors. With challenging programs (from Beethoven to Poulenc), special children concerts (Peter and the Wolf) and a compact rehearsal schedule, these projects are always especially awesome.

    The last project was in February 2017, conducted by Arndt Auhagen, a member of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. The programme contained Beethoven 5 among others. Keep an eye on the news page for more information about a new edition of KrashKO!

    ### Krashna what..?

    Krashna Musika! Or in other words: *‘Lovely Music’* ! Consisting of a symphony orchestra, a choir and several chamber music ensembles we are the student society for classical music in Delft. What do we have in common? That we enjoy playing beautiful music together. And that we like to have a good time!

    ### Concerts

    Each year, under the guidance of our two professional and enthusiastic [conductors](/conductors), we give at least two big concerts with the [symphonic orchestra](/orchestra) and the [choir](/choir). What we play varies from world-renowned pieces to unfamiliar diamonds in the world of classical music. In the past years for example we have performed works by Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, Puccini, Fauré and Bach, but we have also surprised our audience with modern classical music such as a Czech ‘musical’ by Martinů and a wonderful requiem by Daley, which really gave everybody goose bumps. And let’s not forget: at our last lustrum we brought the opera Carmen by Bizet to live with musicians and actors in five virtually sold-out performances at the Auditorium of the TU Delft!

    Besides the symphonic orchestra and the choir we also have a chamber orchestra and a chamber choir. These offer our more advanced members the opportunity to rise to the challenge and  musically develop themselves even more. The chamber orchestra and the chamber choir have their own special concert programmes.

    Furthermore we organize chamber music evenings at Unit Culture and lunch concerts at the faculties of the TU Delft, where our members can perform self-selected pieces with music ensembles that they have created for the occasion. Additionally we sing Christmas carols at the always cozy ‘Lichtjesavond’ (‘evening of lights’) in Delft, we perform regularly at the Free Try Out evenings at Unit Culture and on occasion we perform in the streets to inspire people to attend our upcoming concerts.

    Last but not least: every other year we organize an international tour, in which we seize the opportunity to perform for an international audience and have a wonderful time abroad!

    ### Activities

    The symphonic orchestra and the choir have weekly rehearsals throughout the year (with the exception of holidays). In addition we have for each big concert a fun and intensive rehearsal weekend with everybody. One of these weekends takes place at a large farmers complex in the province of Noord-Brabant, were can go wild musically and in other ways, without being disturbed.

    Besides making music we love doing other fun things together. After the rehearsals we have drinks together, we often organize parties and every so often a formal ball, and once year we go on a sailing week together in the province of Friesland.

    Furthermore we of course have lots of fun [committees](/committees) in which our members take part, such as the committee for our magazine (the Krakra), the committee for selecting new repertoire (the RepCie), the Activities Committee, which organizes parties and other entertaining activities, and many other committees.

    Do you enjoy playing music and having fun with a lot of nice people?

  repertoire: |
    ### Repertoire
    *The second symphony* by the Russian composer *Sergej Rachmaninov*, one of the most important composers and pianists of the 20st century. In 1908, the symphony was performed for the first time and received high praise. Ten months after the première, he received the Glinka award for this successful piece. The symphony is meant for a complete orchestra and consists of four parts, following the Russian symphonic tradition.

    *Mass On. 77 in B flat* by the Austrian composer *Johann Nepomuk Hummel*, although he was born in in Bratislava. He was the last representative of Viennese classical music and influenced the young composers of the romantic area. During his carrier, he was taught by Mozart, Haydn and Salieri. The effect of these classical Viennese influences can be heard in his symphony, which perfectly fits the destination of this lustrum tour.

    ## About Krashna Musika

    The Delft Students Music Association (D.S.M.G.) Krashna Musika is the students classical music association of Delft, The Netherlands. The association consists of a symphony orchestra of around 90 members, a choir of around 50 members and a chamber music department of around 60 members.
    The orchestra is one of the leading Dutch student orchestras which has been performing large symphonic works. Examples of recent projects are Rachmaninoff’s Symphony No. 2, Concerto for Orchestra by Bartok and The Planets by Holst. Besides that there are also projects with soloists on a regular basis. The orchestra aims to a semi-professional level of music. Each year there are at least two programs rehearsed, mostly in cooperation with the choir, at which the orchestra plays a large symphonic work led by the orchestra-conductor and a choir work in a smaller orchestra setting led by the choir conductor (Ruben de Grauw).
    Krashna’s concerts mostly take place in churches in the Delft/Den Haag/Rotterdam region, but also tend to take place in the auditorium of the TU Delft and Muziekgebouw aan het IJ in Amsterdam. Next to that the orchestra and choir go on tour each two years, where they play/sing at special locations. This summer for example, the orchestra and choir went on tour to Bratislava, Brno and Vienna, whereas two years back they went sailing on tour through the waddeneilanden (group of small Dutch islands). For the last 37 years the orchestra of Krashna was directed by Daan Admiraal. With his passing last July, Krashna is looking for a new conductor for the orchestra.

    ## Job description

    Krashna Musika is looking for a conductor of the orchestra who conducts the orchestra from start to end each rehearsal. We rehearse every week on Monday evenings (from 19.30 till 22.30) and organise at least two concert series each year. Each project also comes with a rehearsal weekend. The conductor needs to be both musically and didactically versed. Since we work with amateurmusicians, it is important the conductor plays an active role in practicing the music with the orchestra, both technically and musically. We aim for a high musical level, but it also important the conductor is aware of the student character of the orchestra. Besides that a close cooperation with the choir conductor Ruben de Grauw is of utmost importance.

    The conductor is also a part of both the audition committee and the program committee. This means he/she is present at auditions for the orchestra and is actively involved in the choice of program, together with the program committee.

    This function is available starting at March 11th, when we start our new project for the concert serie in June. The program for this project has already been established. Appointment and payments are performed by the TU Delft.

    ## Qualifications

    - Has at least a Bachelor's degree in orchestra direction, or a provable similar level;
    - Experience with conducting (amateur)symphonic orchestras at a high level, both during rehearsals and concerts;
    - Broad knowledge of symphonic works, with an emphasis on (late)romantic and twentieth-century works;
    - Proven abilities in rehearsal and project planning;
    - Good commandment of the Dutch and/or English language;
    - Experience in working with soloists;
    - Experience in working with the target group (students and young adults) is an advantage.

    ## We offer

    - A permanent appointment at a good and enthusiastic student symphonic orchestra;
