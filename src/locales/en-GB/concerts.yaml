  messiah-2018:
    title: Händel's Messiah
    description: |
      > “Hallelujah: for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.” (Revelation 19: 6)\
      > “The kingdom of this world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of His Christ; and He shall reign for ever and ever.” (Revelation 11: 15)\
      > “King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.” (Revelation 19: 16)\
      > “Hallelujah!”

      *From “Hallelujah”, part 41 of the Messiah (source: [opera.stanford.edu](http://opera.stanford.edu))*

      **A delight to sing, and a delight to hear. This fall, Krashna will perform Georg Friedrich Händel’s most famous piece: the Messiah.**

      The very first performance of the Messiah was in Dublin, in 1742. Before earning his fame as an oratorio composer, Händel was committed to composing Italian opera. When he was already in his fifties in the 1730s the popularity of opera started to fade. As an alternative, Händel introduced English oratorios. His first were already a success: reportedly, undergraduates sold their furniture to afford the five-shilling tickets!

      In 1741, aged 55, Händel abandoned Italian opera for good. Shortly afterwards librettist Charles Jennens sent Händel a new libretto. Jennens wrote:

      > “I hope [Handel] will lay out his whole Genius & Skill upon it, that the Composition may excell all his former Compositions, as the Subject excells every other subject. The Subject is Messiah.”

      Apparently, Händel was promptly hit by a bout of pure inspiration, as he composed the entire three-part oratorio in only 24 days! His genius was quickly recognised: the oratorio was a great success and is still performed frequently to this day.

      In Christian theology, the Messiah is the saviour of the Jewish People, Jesus Christ. In Part I of Händel’s Messiah, the story of the birth of Christ is told. Part II is about Christ’s passion, death, resurrection and ascension, followed by the spreading of the gospel through the world. This spreading was summarised in Hallelujah: by far the most popular part of the Messiah. Part III – the final, shorter part – is then about the promise of redemption, a prediction of the day of judgement and finally the victory over sin and death.

      The Messiah is an impressive performance that every choir should be acquainted with. We at Krashna are very excited to perform it in one of the most beautiful churches of Delft: the Maria van Jessekerk! Come and enjoy this monumental piece with us this December!

  spring-amsterdam-2019:
    title: Tchaikovsky & Rachmaninov
    description: |
      **A haunting epic and a powerful display of virtuosity. Prepare to be blown away by the Krashna orchestra in March 2019 when we will play not one, but two works: the Manfred symphony by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and the second Piano Concerto by Sergei Rachmaninoff.**

      The Manfred symphony, a programmatic symphony, was composed by Tchaikovsky in 1885. Tchaikovsky was inspired by the Gothic poem of the same name, written by Lord Byron in 1817.

      In the poem, the main character Manfred is plagued by guilt about his deceased beloved Astarte. He travels to the Alps and summons seven spirits to help him forget his guilt. The spirits can not help him, and fate prevents him from escaping by suicide. In the end he appears in a bacchanal, meets the shade of Astarte and is pardoned. Manfred then dies free of guilt.

      The four parts of the symphony reflect the storyline of Manfred: the first part, *Lento lugubre*, is about Manfred’s wandering in the Alps, tormented by hopeless longings. This part features the loudest climax Tchaikovsky ever wrote. Then there is the *Vivace con spirito*, about the appearance of the Alpine spirit (probably no pun intended). With little definition of any harmonic base, this part sounds fragile and magical. After that the *Andante con moto* tells a story about the simple life of the mountain folk. Finally, the *Allegro con fuoco* ends the story with the bacchanal, pardoning and death of Manfred, featuring a fugue, unexpected twists and a beautiful Germanic chorale.

      Then there is Rachmaninoff’s second Piano Concerto, where Codarts conservatory student and TU Delft master student Floris van Dam shall play the solo piano part. It is one of Rachmaninoff’s most popular works. At its premiere in 1897, he just recovered from a depression that had lasted several years. From the first chords onwards, you can hear how his self-confidence was renewed.

      It has three parts, *Moderato*, *Adagio sostenuto* and *Allegro scherzando*. Throughout the entire piece it becomes apparent just how virtuosic Rachmaninoff was: the dazzling motives and enormous chords seem nearly impossible but combined with the orchestra create an impressively bombastic performance. An interesting fact: Rachmaninoff’s hands were very large, which is why he was able to play – and thus write – 13th intervals with one hand. That’s more than 30 cm!

      Two pieces full of drama, beauty and excitement. On the 9th of March, Krashna will perform this program in the Dominicuskerk in Amsterdam. Come enjoy a concert of Tchaikovsky’s and Rachmaninoff’s best pieces!
