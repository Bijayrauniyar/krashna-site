    description: |
      On Saturday 2 June, Krashna organises a masterclass day in collaboration with the Delft Chamber Music Festival and Sports & Culture from the TU Delft. During the day, we welcome 4 professional musicians with experience in chamber music to give masterclasses between 10:00 and 17:00 at Unit Culture (Mekelweg 10).

      - Nadine van de Merwe, fagot
      - Célia Garcia-Garcia, piano, [site](https://celiapiano.weebly.com/)
      - Joachim Eijlander, cello, [site](http://www.joachimeijlander.com/)
      - Jasper Leever, bass, [site](http://www.jasperleever.com/)

      The three instrumentalists have been found thanks to the Delft Chamber Music Festival. The singing teacher, Jasper Leever, is actually an old Krashna member. We are very happy and honoured to welcome these 4 top teachers!

      Ensembles can register by filling in [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/RrDZqBs5wiBuSoxT2). Deadline for registering is Friday 25 May! Every masterclass takes an hour; the precise schedule will be published a few days in advance. All masterclasses are free to visit. Spectators are warmly invited! All masterclasses can be freely entered and exited, so visitors can look for themselves which teacher or ensemble they want to watch.

      There will also be a public workshop Alexander Technique, focussed on musicians. This workshop will teach you how to avoid getting injured when practicing an instrument, which will be very useful for any musicians! Registration can be done at location right before the start of the workshop. Masterclass participants can participate for free.

      To close off the day, the masterclass participants will present themselves during a chamber music concert that starts at 19:30. Entrance to this concert is free, as for the other chamber music concerts.
