# Krashna Musika Website

Static site generator for the Krashna Musika site, built with React and Gatsby.js.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need the [Node.js environment](https://nodejs.org) and the [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com). Once you have those installed, run the following commands from the root directory of this repo:

```bash
yarn
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

## Running

### Development

To run a development server (with live-reloading), run:

```bash
gatsby develop
```

The server should now be listening now [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)!

### Production

To build a production bundle, run:

```bash
gatsby build
```

Changes to the `master` branch are automatically deployed to the live site (at [krashna.nl](https://www.krashna.nl/)), through the [Netlify](https://netlify.com) build service.
